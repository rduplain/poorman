    #
    #     parse_procfile_line NAME COMMAND "$procfile_line"
    #     eval set -- "$COMMAND"
    #     exec "$@"
    #
    # Use of eval here allows .env variables to be used in Procfile commands.

    # Understanding poorman internals:
    #
    # poorman reads each line from the Procfile as a simple, unprocessed string
    # (via map_lines), which puts the entire Procfile line into argument `$3`
    # when this function is called.
    #
    # At some point, poorman needs to parse the line from the Procfile exactly
    # as the shell would parse it. The best parser for this is the shell itself
    # (e.g. `set -- "$COMMAND"`), but caution must be taken in order to avoid
    # implicitly processing the string otherwise. Echoing the string will lose
    # quoting and escapes. Parsing the string into an argument array here will
    # hit limitations in what can be exported, since the name of the command
    # variable is taken as an argument. Therefore, this function passes the
    # command as a single opaque string, to be parsed via `set` just before
    # `exec` is to be called by poorman.
    #
    # Further, to be complete, poorman must support backslash escapes. The bash
    # builtin `read` parses differently from `set`, so is not an option given
    # that poorman's design intends to use `set`, as just discussed. Escaping
    # backslashes ("mountains") will ensure that `eval set -- "$COMMAND"` has
    # the correct level of escaping when parsing, with one exception:
    # spaces. '\ ' is special in that its primary intent is to indicate a space
    # in an unquoted word, typically a filepath. As such, backslash-escaped
    # spaces are intended for the shell parser (i.e. `set`) and are the
    # exception in backslash-escaped backslashes (i.e. the "valley" in the
    # "mountains").

    # POSIX, `read` exits non-zero if an end-of-file occurs, which would happen
    # if input ends with a line that does not end with a newline, in which case
    # bash still assigns the value to the given name when exiting non-zero.
